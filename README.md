# Messenger

This is a sample task I did as part of my internship. It's an email-like messenger that allows users to write messages to each other (including oneself), which are stored in a database forever.

### Stack
- TypeScript
- React
- Bootstrap
- Node.js / Express
- MongoDB

### Live version

A deployed version is available [here](https://messenger-5zin.onrender.com/messenger).
